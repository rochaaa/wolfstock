This Delta 3D printing robot is derived from Kossel, Rostock.

It is a big bot providing about a twelve cubic inch build volume.

It uses Makerslide for the linear guides, but any 2040 extrusion with
appropriate wheels should work.

I use Misumi extrusions and brackets, and the scad files use the 3d
cad programs from Misumi for display purposes.
